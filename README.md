# dabien -  a Danish focused Debian USB key

The purpose is to make scripts for making a solid debian usb key focused - but not limited to - danish users.

Its based on the fantastic Debian Live Build platform and composed by reading bash script examples I have found around. 
Thus it is obvious to make it public available and GPL'ed to honor the hard working roots of the work.
