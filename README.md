# dabien -  a Danish focused Debian USB key

The purpose is to make scripts for making a solid debian usb key focused - but not limited to - danish users.
Its based on the fantastic Debian Live Build platform and scripts to put it on USB composed by reading bash script examples I have found around. 
Mainly this: https://gist.github.com/ynezz/ddeef9ffe6e3ce6db8d9f3b451bce37e#file-debian-live-create-usb-key-sh which in turn is based on this https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/382817/uefi-bios-bootable-live-debian-stretch-amd64-with-persistence/382818
Thus it is obvious to make it public available and GPL'ed to honor the hard working roots of the work.
